Makers Making Change is an initiative of [Neil Squire](https://www.neilsquire.ca/), a Canadian non-profit that helps people with disabilities.

We are committed to creating a network of volunteer makers who support people with disabilities in their communities through 3D printing assistive devices. Check out our library of free, open-source assistive technologies with parts and build instructions.
